# Who I am?
#### Am Natively a Ugandan Citizen 👋
ICT has developed tremendously over the last twenty years, and as a result, I have a keen interest in these changes and would like to be a part of them.
From an early age, I've always been deeply interested in using computers, which are the most influential tool in my life. It was my father who first introduced me to computers, majorly into the programming field.

Am pursuing a Nation Certificate in Information and Communication Technology, which has led me wanting to study ***computer science*** in a much greater depth and this has been the obvious subject for my course.

Studying Information security, Cyber Security for urban infrastructure as my other short course has been very helpful in developing my research and academic writing skills. I am also studying Programing at a certificate level from PennX International University.

I've managed to respond to 100-plus emails daily from employees and resolved or escalated all issues within a two-hour window. I am proud of the level of fluency I have achieved in pyhton, Html, Css and more I have had so far.

I will continue to work to achieve even more and make full use of all the facilities github has to offer in order to bring out innovation/IT skills in the community.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills in software development, machine learning, AI and also IoT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the above interests and you are more appreciated for any help if your reading this.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on all events and all programs as to come.
